 trying to get a hold of hospital dataw and use that data that they get for ransom. A threat being this big of a scale provides that the US is lacking in cyber security.</p>

<p>With every passing day that covid continues to impact our daily lives, hackers get the advantage of the fear that people have towards covid. In a new way of hacking called emotet n
malware. Emotet Malware is hackers sending spam mail to victims that will buy into the covid fear mongering and download the pdf for more instruction. By downloading this,
it will steal any of the user's sensitive informaton that they have. This cyber threat can be prevented by avoiding opening emails with any downloads.</p>
