protects against any cyberattacks from the client having this protection. <p>

  
  
  
<h4 style="font-size:18px;">How are individuals getting attacked?</h4>
<p>Since the pandemic has started, there is no doubt that hackers have been taking advantage of their time and coming up with ways to pose cyber threats. 
  These hackers are aiming at individuals who rely on technology. It is always important to have cyber security and safety rules for yourself when using your devices.
  By being safe online 
  We need to be extra vigilant on any types of verification.
</p>

<p>Cyber Security is essential in order to prevent getting attacked by malware or by identity theft. For example <a href=“https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/28/us/hospitals-cyberattacks-coronavirus.html”>this article.</a>, it states that there is a huge threat--hackers are
 trying to get a hold of hospital dataw and use that data that they get for ransom. A threat being this big of a scale provides that the US is lacking in cyber security.</p>

<p>With every passing day that covid continues to impact our daily lives, hackers get the advantage of the fear that people have towards covid. In a new way of hacking called emotet n
malware. Emotet Malware is hackers sending spam mail to victims that will buy into the covid fear mongering and download the pdf for more instruction. By downloading this,
it will steal any of the user's sensitive informaton that they have. This cyber threat can be prevented by avoiding opening emails with any downloads.</p>
