      <p><center>Malware is a general term to refer to any type of “malicious software”
      (malicious software) designed to infiltrate your device without your knowledge. There are many types of malware, and each one seeks its targets in a different way. However, all variants share two defining traits: they are surreptitious
      and actively work against the interests of the person attacked. <br><br><br><br></center></p>

<h2 style="font-size:40px; color:#4d4d4d" ><center>How can it be detected?</center></h2>

<b><center>Malware can manifest itself through various aberrant behaviors. Here are some tell-tale signs that you have malware on your system:<br><br><br><br></center></b>
•The computer slows down. One of the main effects of malware is to slow down the operating system, <br>whether you're browsing the Internet or only using your applications locally.<br><br></li>
<br>
•The screen fills with waves of annoying advertising that should not be shown. Unexpected pop-up ads <br>are a typical sign of malware infection. They are especially associated with a form of malware known as adware . <br> What's more, pop-up messages are often linked to other hidden malware threats. So, if something like <br> "CONGRATULATIONS, YOU WON A FREE SESSION WITH OUR SEER!" in a pop-up message, do not click on it. <br>Whatever prize the ad promises, it will cost you dearly .<br><br>
<br>
•	The system constantly crashes or displays The Blue Screen of Death blue, which can appear <br>on Windows systems when a serious error is encountered.<br><br>
<br>
•	You see a mysterious loss of available disk space, probably due to an unwanted malware occupier hiding <br> on your hard drive.<br><br>
<br>
•	There is a strange increase in system activity on the Internet.<br><br>
<br>
•	System resource utilization is abnormally high and the computer fan begins to run at full speed, indicating <br> that the malware activity has taken over system resources in the background.<br><br>
<br>
•	The browser's home page changes without your permission. Likewise, the links you click take you to an <br>unwanted web destination. This usually means that you clicked on that “congratulations” pop-up, <br> that you downloaded some unwanted software . It is also possible that the browser responds very slowly.<br><br>
<br>
•	The browser unexpectedly fills up with new toolbars, extensions, or add-ons.<br><br>
<br>
•	Your antivirus product stops working and you can't update it, leaving you unprotected against the rogue <br> malware that disabled it.<br><br>
