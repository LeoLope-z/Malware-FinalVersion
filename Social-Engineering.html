  <h1>Social Engineering</h1>
  <p>The term social engineering in the context of personal security information is the use of deception to manipulate individuals into divulging confidential or personal information that may be used for fraudulent purposes. Social engineering is a strategy cyber attackers use which involves tricking people into breaking standard security practices. When successful, many social engineering attacks enable attackers to gain legitimate unauthorized access to confidential information. Many of these tactics are used to gain full control of ones personal data information that may come in the form of an email containing a link or downloadable file. There are many ways a cyber attackers can do this.</p>

  <p>There are four emotions social engineers exploit in order to gain access of personal information. Fear, Obedience, greed, and helpfulness are all emotions that can be manipulated by attackers. Fear is perhaps the most commonly used form to trick individuals to hand over personal information. Obedience stems from when attackers pose as authority figures usually sending out emails or phone calls in hopes of stealing information. Greed usually derives in the form of emails or phone calls where attackers send fake emails claiming the receiver has won x amount of money and all that is needed is a few personal information details in exchange. It is important to note that these four emotions are usually exploited to trick individuals but overall hacking of personal information is not limited by those factors.</p>
